Before using this, you will need to set up the save anywhere mod for Kingdom Hearts Final Mix HD. 
You can find that here, https://github.com/S0nzero/KHPCSpeedrunTools/tree/main
Either follow the directions in the previous link on how to set this up, or watch my tutorial video at 
The scripts I would recommend using are 1fmInstantGummi.lua and 1fmSaveAnywhere.lua
If you plan to change anything, like adding your own saves or folders, make sure you keep the same file structure I already have. 
Please do not change any existing folder names. 
If you want to change a file name, you may, though refrain from using any underscores in the file names outside of the Boss Rush folders.
