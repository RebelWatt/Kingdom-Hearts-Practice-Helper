2. Download the 1fmSaveAnywhere.lua and 1fmInstantGummi.lua from https://github.com/S0nzero/KHPCSpeedrunTools/tree/main/1FMMods/scripts and install it by following their instructions
3. Load your Kingdom Hearts game and load a save. This should create the autosave.dat file in you kh1.5+2.5 folder
4. Download Kingdom Hearts Practice Helper.exe
5. Download any and all saves that you require from https://github.com/RebelWatt/Kingdom-Hearts-Practice-Helper
6. After running Kingdom Hearts Practice Helper.exe, click the top button to select the folder with all of your saves

10. Once the file you want to practice is selected, while tabbed into your Kingdom Hearts game, press the button command on your controller to load an auto save. L1+L2+R1+R2+right on d-pad

## Add Custom Saves
1. Update your autosave.dat by doing a room transition or saving then reloading the game
2. Move your autosave.dat file from your kh1.5+2.5 folder to your saves folder. Place it in the correct world it belongs to
3. Change the name of the autosave.dat in your saves folder to whatever you want. If you want it to appear in a certain list order, use the same naming convention that I use. ex: 001_Anti Sora.dat
    * If you put a number and underscore at the beginning of the name, be sure to have it be 3 numbers then an underscore. Anything else will cause the file to not be named correctly when viewing it in the program.
